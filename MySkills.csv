Zeroth row,Blank0,,1,5,5,
First row,Python,Python,1,0,4.5,"I have used python for many different kinds of tasks, such as web scraping and subsequent data cleaning and analysis, solving differential equations, cleaning and normalising data for insertion into relational databases, connecting to and querying relational databases and of course data visualisation. Please see my GitHub profile for the details of a few of my public projects."
First row,SQL,SQL,1,2,4.5,"I have learnt SQL and used several database management systems, such as MySQL and SQLite. Please see my GitHub profile for the details of a few of my public projects, in particular, see MySQL IMDb and SQLite ChinesePod projects."
First row,Tableau,Tableau,1,4,4.5,"Development of visualisations, dashboards and stories. I have published a few of my visualisations on Tableau public."
Second row ,MySQL DBMS,MySQL DBMS,1,1,4,"I am familiar with the database management system MySQL. Please see my GitHub profile for the details of a few of my public projects, in particular, see my MySQL IMDb project."
Second row,SQLite,SQLite,1,3,4,"I am familiar with the database management system SQLite. Please see my GitHub profile for the details of a few of my public projects, in particular, see my SQLite ChinesePod project."
Second row,Blank2,,1,5,4,
Third row ,Pandas,Pandas,1,0,3.5,"Pandas is a great python library which I have used a lot to perform data manipulation, cleaning and analysis."
Third row ,Scikit learn,Scikit learn ,1,2,3.5,Scikit learn is a great python library which I have used to train and use many machine learning models.
Third row ,Matplotlib,Matplotlib,1,4,3.5,Matplotlib is great python library which I have used many times over to perform data visualisation.
Fourth row ,Numpy,Numpy,1,1,3,"Numpy is the indispensable numerical linear algebra python library, which I have made extensive use of in many projects."
Fourth row ,Seaborn,Seaborn,1,3,3,Seaborn is another good python library which I have used many times over to perform data visualisation.
Fourth row,Blank4,,1,5,3,
Fifth row,BeautifulSoup,BeautifulSoup,1,0,2.5,"Beautiful soup is a fantastic python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It reduces the amount of tedious work when extracting data from these kinds of files. I have used it in several web scraping projects. Please see my GitHub profile for the details of a few of my public projects, in particular, see my ChinesePod and Skritter scraper projects."
Fifth row,Selenium,Selenium,1,2,2.5,"Selenium is a framework which is designed to automate the testing of web applications. It is possible to write a python script to control the browser, such as link clicks and form submissions. Selenium really shines when you want to scrape data from websites that contain content generated by javascript, as javascript adds to the complexity of the task. I have used it in several web scraping projects. Please see my GitHub profile for the details of a few of my public projects, in particular, see my ChinesePod and Skritter scraper projects."
